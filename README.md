# Financial Fraud Expert System

This is my master's thesis project: an AI-based expert system for detecting fraud in financial documents using NLP, Computer Vision, and Explainable AI.

Capabilities include:
- OCR-based text extraction
- Text-only fraud detection models (baseline)
- Image-based fraud detection models (CNN/ResNet)
- Multimodal fusion (BERT + ResNet)
- Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM)
- Expert rule layer (heuristic decision logic)
